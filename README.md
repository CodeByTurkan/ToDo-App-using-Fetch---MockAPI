Edit Task: Users can edit the text of an existing task by clicking the "EDIT" button.

Delete Task: Users can remove a task by clicking the "DELETE" button.

Tasks are stored and retrieved from a mock API for persistence.

HTML: For the structure of the app.

CSS: For styling the todo list interface.

JavaScript: For implementing the logic and interacting with the API.

Fetch API: For making HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to interact with the mock API.
